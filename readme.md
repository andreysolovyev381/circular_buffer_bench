### Benchmarking boost::circular_buffer vs std::vector and std::deque

I have a specific usage, so I am mostly interesting in comparing the pop_front() functionality of these three comrades. 
See the benchmark result in the dedicated file. 

Feel free to use at your own riks, no guarantees are given whatsoever.
